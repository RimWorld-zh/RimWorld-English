  <MultiAnalyzer.label>multi-analyzer</MultiAnalyzer.label>
  <MultiAnalyzer.description>Allows colonists to build multi-analyzers which increase research speed, and allow higher-level research projects, if placed near a research bench.</MultiAnalyzer.description>

  <LongRangeMineralScanner.label>long-range mineral scanner</LongRangeMineralScanner.label>
  <LongRangeMineralScanner.description>Allows the construction of long-range mineral scanners which automatically detect precious minerals like gold or jade in the nearby areas (but not in which the scanners were built).\n\nThe lumps are found on average once per 30 days within a radius of 30 tiles.\n\nBuilding more than one scanner in the same or nearby areas has little to no effect.</LongRangeMineralScanner.description>
