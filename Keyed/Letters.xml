  <FirstSummerWarning>Summer has begun! But winter is coming.\n\nYour food crops won't grow in the winter cold. Be sure to store enough food to survive.

  <LetterRelationsChange_Hostile>Relations with {0} have broken down completely. They are now hostile to you.\n\nThey will conduct periodic raids on your colony and caravans, and refuse to trade with you. If you want to improve relations, you can still offer them gifts using caravans or transport pods.\n\nThis happened because goodwill ({1}) has fallen below {2}. In order to restore neutral relations, goodwill must reach {3} again.</LetterRelationsChange_Hostile>
  <LetterRelationsChange_NeutralFromHostile>Relations with {0} have warmed. They now consider you neutral and will no longer attack you.\n\nThis happened because goodwill ({1}) has risen past {2}.

  <LetterRelationsChange_NeutralFromAlly>Relations with {0} have cooled. They now consider you neutral instead of allied.\n\nWhile they will still interact peacefully with you, they will no longer send fighters to help you when you are under threat.\n\nThis happened because goodwill ({1}) has fallen below {2}. If goodwill falls below {3}, {0} will become hostile. If goodwill rises above {4}, they will become allied once again.</LetterRelationsChange_NeutralFromAlly>
  <LetterRelationsChange_Ally>Relations with {0} have become very close. They now consider you an ally.\n\nAllies will sometimes arrive to help fight your enemies when you are under attack. You can also call them for help at any time, at a cost of goodwill.\n\nYou've become allies because your goodwill ({1}) has risen past {2}. If goodwill falls below {3}, relations will return to neutral.</LetterRelationsChange_Ally>
