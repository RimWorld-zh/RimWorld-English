  <!-- Game updated to new version -->
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionInitial>RimWorld has been updated from version {0} to version {1}.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionInitial>
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionSavesIncompatible>This may cause saved games and mods from the old version to stop working.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionSavesIncompatible>
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionSavesCompatible>Saved games from the old version should be compatible, however some mods may stop working.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionSavesCompatible>
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionNonSteam>Since this is a DRM-free copy, you can install the game twice in two different folders, to be able to play both old and new versions.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionNonSteam>
  <GameUpdatedToNewVersionSteam>If you wish to continue with the old version, you can opt in using Steam's "Betas" feature.\n\n  1. In the Steam library, right-click RimWorld.\n  2. Click Properties.\n  3. Click the Betas tab.\n  4. Select the version you want from the drop-down menu.\n\nOld versions will be likely removed from this list eventually - we just didn't want to cut off games in progress.\n\nNote that if mod authors update their mods for a new game version, they'll probably stop working on an old version. You may want to turn off automatic updates to prevent this.</GameUpdatedToNewVersionSteam>
